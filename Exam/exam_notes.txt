""" Mock Exam 30/11/2021 """

# MCQ section

Main memory stores data while program is running and the data the program is working with

# this prints out each codon in mydnaseq on a separate line
while len(mydnaseq) > 0:
	print(mydnaseq[0] + mydnaseq[1] + mydnaseq[2]);
	mydnaseq = mydnaseq[3:]

# print the last character of each line in the file
for line in open('justDNA.txt'):
	print(line.rstrip(' ')[-1])

# Short answer section

what is a function
- components
- indentation
- assertion
- encapsulation
- try except
- return if error
write a short function
- rounding output

# how is eddie different from server
- ram/ disk space/ computing power(cores) more than the bioinfmsc server
- options for parallelization using the grid engine
- scratch space (one month or when full) vs home space (small)

why use eddie / why not

# code plan to use eddie
- have to load module (module load python3)
- q commands
- -e export error messages to local
- scp
- analysis script, try on in qlogin
- wait for job to run

describe the input/output image
how is this used?

example five different python data types
- string
- set
- dictionaries
- dataframe
- integer
- list
- tuples
- floats
- boolean
- nonetype

each as different biological data they store

key features that make git and github useful
code example of setting repo in server, push contents to github acc
