txid	taxon identifier

[organism:exp]	

txid6231[Organism:exp] AND COX1[Gene Name]

txid6231[Organism:exp] AND COX1[Gene Name] NOT PARTIAL		returns full sequences only
### how does one figure out that the sequence is partial or not, experimentally?


txid6231[Organism:exp] AND (COX1[Gene Name] OR CO1[Gene Name])	to check for alt gene names

standardized format for metadata on a sequence/protein

annotations:
left are "keys"
right are "qualifiers"
numbers = where the seq came from (database)

GenPept format for origin
group of 10 amino acids, separated by a space

//  indicates the end of the GenPept origin format


CDS - coding segment, which region the protein is coded from



FASTA
short form of the protein - header and sequence
60 amino acids per line, no space


Accession list - shorter?
depends on how many to "see" per page


Clustalo - tool to align protein sequences
-- minus signs are fitted to make it look better
Jalview - better viewing experience of the alignments
run programs in threads - parallel runs

###
Emboss - european mol bio software suite
USA - an accession number?
-winsize 	making a smooth curve? defaults to 4 amino acid views at a time
		window size 10 get smoother curve bcs u average over a bigger value


###
NCBIs eutils		ways of accessing the database
esearch/eutils >> efetch/retrieval
splitting the line "<|>" when see left/right hand arrow, split using that bar symbol
-qO- quietly, send output to screen
split(line, whattosplitinto, whattousetosplit)

exporting variable in awk		need to send it as text into a file
grep -m3 ">" 	find the first three header matches to ">"

.nuc.gis format ???
