# BLAST vs pairwise alignmen (Smith-Waterman)

High scoring Segment Pair (HSP)		Try to extend the seed match until the longest match
					HSPs can be merged to make longer matches

A few bases are aligned and fitted to measure score. Then compared to another aligned set's score. 
The set with higher score gets chosen for next fit ??


# Protein

Probability of picking an aminoacid 	VCPKKCS

Probability of picking an amino acid is not equal! Esp in a sequence and in pairings.

PAM matricees				high (distant-related), low (close-related)

BLOSUM					Blocks Substitutiton Matrix
					BLOSUM62 matrix built using seqs with 62% similarity at most

Changing matrix changes the scoring system - important which matrix you choose!

Bitscore				The value that is attached to the bit of alignment/seq that is scored
					Param: matrix, query length, word size, database size
						Better chance of getting a match with bigger database, shorter words

HSP bitscore converted to E-value	Karlin-Altscul stats
					

Access database remotely		Always gets updated, take note when it's accesed/version



## NCBI database

GI number		old notation for genes
Accession number NC	new notation for seq ref for a specific sequence


ls -lh			list out files, in humanly way

blastx output is sorted out by e-value on default, most sequence similar is put at the top
